1. A ball thrown horizontally from a point 30 m above the ground strikes the ground after traveling horizontally a distance of 20 m. With what speed was it thrown? 

2. A girl throws a rock horizontally with a velocity of 12 m/s from a bridge. It falls 20 m to the water below. How far from the bridge does the rock go?(horizontal distance)

3.  A pitcher throws horizontally a fast ball at 155 km/h toward home plate, which is 18.3 m away. Neglecting air resistance (not a good idea if you are the batter), find how far the ball drops because of gravity by the time it reaches home plate.

4.  projectile is shot from the edge of a cliff 180 m above ground with an initial speed of 60 m/s at an angle of 40 degrees above the horizontal. What is the time taken by the projectile to hit the ground 180 m below the cliff?
